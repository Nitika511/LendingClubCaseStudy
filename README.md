Lending-Club-Case-Study

Problem: Credit loss, incurred when borrowers default on loans, is a significant financial challenge for lending institutions.

Objective: To mitigate credit loss by accurately identifying high-risk loan applicants.

Approach: Employ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key variables or predictors associated with loan default. These insights will inform the development of predictive models and risk assessment strategies.

Goal: Identify and analyze the correlation between borrower characteristics, loan attributes, and loan default status to determine the primary drivers of credit loss.

## General Information
- This project is a case study for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
The loan dataset used here is about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.


## Technologies Used
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Python (Numpy and pandas)
